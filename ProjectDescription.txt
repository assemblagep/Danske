Fixed
1. Added concurrent queue instead of list as a log buffer.
2. Rearranged code: NewLogFile() for new log file creation,CheckDate() for dates comparing, PrintLogLine() for log printing etc.
3. Created new constructor with currentTime parameter for testing.

 
 
Unit tests

1. Positive test to check logger write ability. 
2. Positive tests for logger stop with/without flush.
3. Positive test for midnight log file creation.
